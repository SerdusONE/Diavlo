This program is the original "Diavlo MC" source uncompiled, the devs of this program claim that they used c++, which is not the case (python) and i managed to get a copy of this program, if you find any way to deobfuscate the uncompiled uncompiled/Diavlo.py please open a pull request with it, i would appreciate it, also keep in mind that this is not an ilegal action or repository, since nothing in here is private information, you can do whatever you want, just know that having a copy of this program will not make you be able to use it, since they have an auth system.

if i can get the deobfuscated source code i would make a newer client for this program in rust, since it can take hours to finish cracking passwords in python, also this is the V2 and they are working on a V3 of this program with a really good GUI, no hate for the devs, they just should use a better language for this purpose and not lie.

Have fun!

/original: exactly what comes in the program (without brute.txt file)
/extracted: extracted files from /original/Diavlo v2.exe
/uncompiled: /extracted/Diavlo.pyc python source (still obfuscated with pyarmor)
/deobfuscated: deobfuscated /uncompiled/Diavlo.py (pure python) (FUTURE)
